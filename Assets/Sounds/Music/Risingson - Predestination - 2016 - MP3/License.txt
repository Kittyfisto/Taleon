Welcome to Predestination, the debut release from Risingson, also known as Ohmar, a truly promising artist now entering the psychedelic bass music scene with help from Digital Whomp. Whether making it heavy with the opening track “Digital Being”, or going deeper but still raw with “Robosapiens” and “Predestination”, the music tells wonderful and trippy stories through intricate melodies, sharp bass sounds, and groovy beats.
