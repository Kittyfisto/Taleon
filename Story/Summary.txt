The player's an employee of <Insert Corporation>, specifically part of its so called self defense force.
The <Insert Corporation> SDF is tasked with maintaing law and order in and around <Insert Corporation> both manned and unmanned stations
as well as to protect its ships. In short, it ensures that the company remains profitable.

At first, the player is tasked with simple patrolling and escorting missions where he encounteres one or two hostiles, but nothing really dangerous happens.
The third mission or so is to find a missing science ship that was tasked with evaluating the viability of a mining operation
in Neptune's Adams ring.

Once there, the player finds the science ship, however it doesn't answer any hails. Upon closing, the ship is shown to have suffered no damage.
The ship is eventually boarded, however there is no sign of the crew. Nor is there any explanation as to why the crew has vanished.
On the bridge, the player finds out that the logs have been whiped and the fligth recorder is missing.
