The Asteros Group was one of the earliest corporations to not only realize the potential of space expansion,
but to actually implement it. The group started mining asteroids to provide raw resources to other corporations,
but quickly expanded into various other markets including planet-to-orbit shipping, inter-planetary shipping
protection and providing free fall space (i.e. renting out parts of their stations).

Since its beginning more than a century ago, asteros has moved its earth-based headquarters to space due to most
of its business being located in space. This caused major friction with earth's old governments due to Asteros
no longer paying corporation taxes to its previous hosts.

Asteros maintains a constant presence in several low planetary orbits such as Earth, Mars, Ceres and Saturn as well
as several ground based operations on Titan. On top of it, Asteros maintains several remote science outposts in the
"corners" of the sol system.
