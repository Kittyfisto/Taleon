Introduce two characters to players ship that don't like each other.
The player could be privy to banter between them. See Neeshka & Khelgar for reference (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuYhgQnEyww)
There shouldn't be true hatred or conflict for the sake of it, instead it should be humorous
to loosen up the atmosphere.

I'd like to play with the idea of old governments banning groups of people from ever visting earth again.
It might provide for interesting conflict between characters:
 - "You don't know how good you have it on earth! I'll never get to see an ocean ever again."
However this idea could conflict with the thought of corporations being incredibly powerful, so maybe people
aren't banned from earth but from mars/europa?

Think about introducing "cool" modulations on radio chatter (e.g. BSG). It might be helpful to hear the difference
between communication on the same ship versus inter ship coms.
