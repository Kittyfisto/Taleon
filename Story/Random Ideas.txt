Introduce two characters to players ship that don't like each other.
The player could be privy to banter between them. See Neeshka & Khelgar for reference (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuYhgQnEyww)
There shouldn't be true hatred or conflict for the sake of it, instead it should be humorous
to loosen up the atmosphere.
