Chapter 0

OUTLINE

We are introduced to the player's ship, the <Ship Name>. It is currently docked at <Nestor Station>,
being serviced. The ship is docked in a "dry dock" with it's hangar doors closed. We get to see various close
ups of the ship and the hangar while the ship is booted up and getting ready to undock.
The hangar doors open and the ship maneuvers outside the hangar.

After having performed tests on the RCS thrusters, the ship engages its main engines to start testing its
weapon systems. The test involves launching drones, targeting them and performing simulated combat.
The point defense system is tested by having the drones fire "blank" missiles at the ship. Finally,
the primarily offensive weapons are tested against drones.

Once all tests have been performed, the ship reports ready status and is assigned to a high value freighter leaving
<Nestor Station> for LEO. The ship is tasked to intercept the freighter and protect it all the way to earth.

A few uneventful days pass as both ships intercept an SOS from a freighter of the same corporation.
They report the distress call to HQ and the player's captain decides to heed the call.

Once the distress call's location is found and intercepted, we find a badly damaged ship as well as lots of debries.
The ship is circled and it is decided that the player should dock with the remains to salvage whatever information
they can (there are no magical scanners that do this from afar).

The captain puts together a small crew and proceeds to board the other vessel. Once aboard, a volley of missiles
is detected that head both for the <Ship Name> as well as the badly damaged vessel. They are too many
to be fully intercepted by the point defense system and they strike both the wreck as well as the <Ship Name>.

The player, as executive officer, has to take command and defeat the pirate ship that was hiding in the debries field.
The mission ends once the ship is defeated.


=== BEGIN SCRIPT ===

A space station is shown, orbiting a moon (Titan) of Jupiter is shown.

<Insert background radio chatter>

Cut to inside of station.
We see a ship inside a hangar.

It looks like the ship was in maintenance.

We see personel leaving the hangar.
Docking clamps are released.
The hangar door opens.

XO: "That was the last batch. We're fully loaded and ready to fly, ma'am".
Captian: "Thank you, <insert player name>. Let's go."

<Cue shipwide "ringtone", see BSG for example>
Captain, Shipwide: "This is the commander. Man all stations and prepare for immediate undocking."

Captian: "Coms, request permission to undock."
Communication Officer: "Aye, aye ma'am."

Communication Officer: "NTC, this is Support Frigate Osiris requesting permission to undock, over."
Station: "Osiris, this is Nestor Traffic Control, permission granted. Godspeed."

Captian: "Take us out <insert player name>, slow and steady."

Sirens begin to sound and lights go off inside the hangar, presumably to warn anyone still inside the hangar
that air is about to be vented.

Most personel leave the hangar and doors start to close.
We can hear a whissing sound from the air being pumped out of space.

The ship's reactors come alive. It's lights go on, but the main engine stays off (and doesn't show any sign).

The hangar lights change color once again (to signal that the doors are about to be opened any second) and a few
seconds later, the hangar doors start to open (sliding to the side).

The ship's RCS thrusters begin to push to one side while the ship is still connected, so it won't start
drifting to the side once the connection is severed.

XO: "Release docking clamps."
Nav: "Releasing docking clamps."

The docking clamps are released and retract to the ceiling.

XO: "Take us out, <insert nav name>."
Nav: "Yessir."

The forward RCS thrusters are engaged and the ship slowly drifts backwards, outside the hangar.
We see the ship slowly exiting the hangar, moving away from the station until it is no longer at risk at
colliding with the rotation parts of it.

We see sections of the station crossing paths with the ship as it drifts away.
A tanker from the surface of Titan is proceding to dock.
Another (interplanetary) tanker is leaving the Jupiter System for the inner colonies.

Captian: "XO, Set course to intercept the <Sister Ship Name>. We will support her in patrolling LTO."
XO: "Aye Aye, Cpt."

=== Start random thoughts ===
This could be the place for the first interaction of the player, but maybe we'll cut it?
Discuss!
=== End random thoughts ===

XO: "<insert nav name> calculate and execute intercept course for <Sister Ship Name>."
XO: "<insert coms name> hail the <Sister Ship Name> and inform her of our arrival."

The ship's RCS thrusters quickly turn the ship around and we see it's main engine spooling up.
It fires and <Nestor Station> is quickly left behind.
