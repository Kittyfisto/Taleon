A space station is shown, orbiting a moon (Titan) of Jupiter is shown.

<Insert radio chatter>

Cut to inside of station.
We see a ship inside a hangar.

It looks like the ship was in maintenance.

We see personel leaving the hangar.
Docking clamps are released.
The hangar door opens.

Captian: "This is <Ship Name>. Requesting permission for take off"
Station: "This is <Nestor Station>. Roger <Ship Name>, you are cleared for take off. Godspeed."

The ship's reactors come alive.
Lights go on, the engine starts to spool (but isn't fired inside the station!).
The ship's RCS thrusters rotate the ship around and move it outside the station.

The ship slowly drifts away from the station.

We see sections of the station crossing paths with the ship as it drifts away.
A tanker from the surface of Titan is proceding to dock.
Another (interplanetary) tanker is leaving the Jupiter System for the inner colonies.

Captian: "XO, Set course to intercept the <Sister Ship Name>. We will support her in patrolling LTO."
XO: "Aye Aye, Cpt."

<The player has to input the course to intercept <Sister Ship Name>>

We see the ship's main engine firing up, slowly accelerating the ship.
We look back at <Nestor Station>, getting smaller and smaller.
