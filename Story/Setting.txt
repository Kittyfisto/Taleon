Several bodies of the solar system are inhabited.
Earth is (still) inhabited, most of humanity lives there.
Almost 500 million people live on the moon.
Mars is fully colonized (i.e. green).

We're in the 23rd century. (Is this reasonable?)

Humany has established remote outposts in most corners of the system:
The great belt, Jupiter, Saturn Uranus and Neptune feature a lot of space cities.

On old earth, countries still exist, however corporations have most of the power.
Space is colonized only by the most powerful countries and corporations alike.

(China is the most prominent power).


Obviously space is militarized, however there hasn't been much conflict in the last (xxx).

(Maybe there should be some sort of Washington Treaty that limits the maximum mass of battleships.
One faction could start to breakt it to start the conflict that is featured in the game).
